Isoform-specific perturb-seq reveals alternative promoter dynamics in gene regulation and drug response


CRISPR-dCas9 technologies are designed to modulate gene expression. However, our findings reveal that many hits are promoter and isoform-specific. Leveraging this specificity, we developed an isoform-specific single-cell Perturb-Seq screen, showing that alternative promoters frequently compensate for targeted knockdowns and drive divergent gene expression programs at the single-cell level. Importantly, these isoform-specific effects influence drug response in breast cancer, underscoring the relevance of alternative promoters in functional genomics and drug discovery.
